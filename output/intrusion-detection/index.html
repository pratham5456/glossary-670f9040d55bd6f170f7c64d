        <p>The process of monitoring network or system activities for malicious activities or policy violations.</p>

                <h2>Description</h2>

            
                <p>Intrusion detection refers to the practices and technologies used to identify unauthorized access or anomalies within a computer system or network. In the context of cybersecurity regulations impacting B2B marketing strategies in 2023, intrusion detection plays a critical role. As businesses increasingly rely on digital platforms for marketing, they face heightened scrutiny under regulations aimed at protecting sensitive data. Effective intrusion detection systems (IDS) can help organizations comply with these regulations by monitoring network traffic, analyzing data for suspicious patterns, and alerting security teams to potential breaches. This capability not only mitigates risks associated with cyber threats but also strengthens the trust of clients and partners, who are more likely to engage with businesses that prioritize cybersecurity. The regulatory landscape encourages companies to adopt robust intrusion detection measures, which can also influence marketing narratives focused on security and trustworthiness. By integrating these systems, businesses can effectively protect their data, enhance their reputation, and align their marketing strategies with compliance requirements.</p>

            
                <h2>Examples</h2>

            
                <ul>
<li>Network-based Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) that monitor traffic on the network for suspicious activity.</li>
<li>Host-based Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS) that analyze the behavior of individual devices for signs of compromise.</li>
</ul>

            
                <h2>Additional Information</h2>

            
                <ul>
<li>Intrusion detection can be classified into two main types: signature-based and anomaly-based detection.</li>
<li>Regulatory frameworks, such as GDPR and CCPA, often require businesses to implement effective cybersecurity measures, including intrusion detection.</li>
</ul>
