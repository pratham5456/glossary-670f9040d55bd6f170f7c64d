                <h2>Description</h2>

            
                <p>Network segmentation is a cybersecurity strategy that involves dividing a larger network into smaller, isolated segments. This practice is crucial for enhancing security, as it limits the potential impact of a cyber attack by containing threats within a specific segment rather than allowing them to spread throughout the entire network. In the context of B2B marketing strategies impacted by cybersecurity regulations in 2023, network segmentation plays a vital role in protecting sensitive customer and transaction data. By creating distinct segments for different business units, companies can enforce tailored security protocols that comply with regulatory requirements while also optimizing their marketing efforts. For example, a company could segment its network to separate customer relationship management (CRM) systems from general marketing systems, ensuring that customer data remains secure and compliant with regulations such as GDPR or CCPA. Overall, effective network segmentation not only enhances security but also supports compliance and boosts operational efficiency.</p>

            
                <h2>Examples</h2>

            
                <ul>
<li>Segmenting a network by department, allowing finance to operate on a different network than marketing.</li>
<li>Creating a guest network for visitors that is completely isolated from the main corporate network.</li>
</ul>

            
                <h2>Additional Information</h2>

            
                <ul>
<li>Network segmentation can improve performance by reducing congestion on the main network.</li>
<li>It helps organizations meet compliance requirements by isolating sensitive data.</li>
</ul>
