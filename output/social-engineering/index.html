        <p>Manipulative tactics used to exploit human psychology in order to gain confidential information or access.</p>

                <h2>Description</h2>

            
                <p>In the context of cybersecurity, social engineering refers to the psychological manipulation of individuals into performing actions or divulging confidential information. This form of attack leverages human emotions such as fear, trust, or urgency to deceive targets. For B2B marketing strategies, the implications of social engineering are profound, especially as businesses increasingly rely on digital communication channels. Cybersecurity regulations in 2023 have heightened awareness around these tactics, necessitating that companies implement robust training and awareness programs for employees. The goal is to mitigate the risk of falling victim to social engineering schemes, which can compromise sensitive data and lead to significant financial losses. B2B marketers must not only focus on promoting their products and services but also emphasize the importance of security practices in their messaging. By addressing the vulnerabilities that social engineering exploits, companies can build trust with their clients and position themselves as responsible entities in a landscape where cybersecurity is paramount.</p>

            
                <h2>Examples</h2>

            
                <ul>
<li>Phishing emails that impersonate a trusted source to extract sensitive information.</li>
<li>Pretexting, where an attacker creates a fabricated scenario to obtain confidential data from a victim.</li>
</ul>

            
                <h2>Additional Information</h2>

            
                <ul>
<li>Social engineering attacks are often less technical and more about exploiting human behavior.</li>
<li>Training employees to recognize social engineering tactics is a critical component of a strong cybersecurity strategy.</li>
</ul>
